The Rational Investor's Toolkit

A computational philosophy project exploring randomness, skill, and decision-making through Python simulations

Project Overview
This project tests Nassim Taleb's concepts from *Fooled by Randomness* using quantitative simulations. It investigates how randomness masquerades as skill in financial markets and decision-making, blending philosophy, physics, and data science.

Key Questions
- How do we statistically distinguish luck from skill?
- What ethical implications arise when systems reward randomness?
- Can we design decision-making frameworks that minimize "luck tyranny"?
